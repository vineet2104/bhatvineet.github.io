I am a second year PhD student at NYU working on the application of Vision Language Models in Robotics. I have degrees in Physics and Artificial Intelligence, and I use my background to understand the real physical world, developing AI models that can reason with real world interactions. These AI models are derivatives of powerful foundational models like ChatGPT, and my research is motivated to decipher how much these models understand the real world. In short, yes I'm trying to make robots as smart as humans! But don't worry, we're far from fully autonomous artificial beings (as of 2024!)

At my core, I'm a problem solver who likes to solve the toughest of problems. My interests are quite diverse - data science, mathematics, physics, stock markets and I try my best to stay connected with the latest of updates in these areas. If you're interested in a quick overview of my profile, I'll make my CV available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14F8eogBJRGKR3EBILaLlklJQnr8qV5MZ/view?usp=sharing). But if you have some time, feel free to scroll through this website. I promise you'll be entertained :)
